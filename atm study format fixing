A. Introduction



B. The process of Interaction Design

In the field of Interaction design, in involves four basic process mainly known as the Identifying needs and establishing 
requirements, developing alternative designs, building the interactive version of the design and the last process which 
is evaluating. These four activities of Interaction design serves as the frame or skeleton in the case study, it provides
the criteria for us to evaluate the over-all design of the machine. Every machine must undergo these processes to identify
and meet the specific task is should perform. Having knowledge of what Interaction Design is provides ease on how to 
evaluate the Product on this Case Study. It will also allow us formulate questions such as does it meet the requirements
given or what are the possible improvements for this design. This serves as the guide not only to have the knowledge to
criticize but also the ability to see the improvement and build alternative design for the product. In simple word the
Interaction design help to identify the machine our case study if it is properly planned.
